Claude SDK Client Configuration with Playwright Docker Support
==============================================================

This version removes the external Playwright MCP server when using Docker sandbox,
since Playwright now runs inside the Docker container directly.

    This configuration is designed for containerized environments where the agent
    needs broad command access to work autonomously without constant permission prompts.
