# TODO-FUTURE - Post-Release Enhancements

This document tracks enhancements and features planned for **after** the initial YokeFlow release.

**Last Updated:** December 27, 2025 (v1.1.0)

**Note:** This document has been simplified for v1.1.0 to focus on future enhancements. Completed features are marked with ✅ but descriptions are now concise. For full implementation details, see the git history or [docs/review-system.md](docs/review-system.md).

## 🎯 POST-RELEASE PRIORITIES

### 1. Prompt Improvement System (Phase 4 of Review System)
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Production ready (December 2025)

**Implemented Features:**
- Multi-project and single-project analysis
- Theme-based clustering (8 categories)
- Confidence scoring and prioritization
- Web UI dashboard with trigger controls
- Evidence tracking with session links

**Documentation:** See [docs/review-system.md](docs/review-system.md#phase-4-prompt-improvement-analyzer--new)

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Project-Type-Specific Prompts**: Tag projects by type (UI-focused, Mobile App, AI Agent, etc.) and generate scoped improvements
- ML-based semantic similarity clustering
- A/B testing for prompt changes
- Prompt version tracking and comparison
- **Automatic Proposal Application**: One-click apply with git integration, diff preview, and rollback capability
- **Impact Tracking**: Measure quality improvements after implementing changes (schema fields already exist)

**Priority:** Core feature complete - enhancements are LOW priority 

### 2. Multiple Spec Files Upload - Advanced Features
**Status:** ✅ Core feature complete - Advanced features deferred

**Advanced Features:**
1. **Database Metadata Storage**: Track spec file metadata in projects table (JSONB column)
2. **LLM-Based Primary File Detection**: Use Claude Haiku for content-based detection (~$0.001/project)
3. **Advanced Manifest Parsing**: YAML/TOML frontmatter with conditional includes
4. **Spec File Versioning**: Track changes across sessions with diff view
5. **Template Bundles**: Pre-packaged spec sets for common project types

**Priority:** MEDIUM (implement based on user feedback)
**Estimated Effort:** 16-23 hours

### 3. Intervention System - Database Implementation
**Status:** 🚧 UI Complete, Database Integration Pending

**What's Implemented:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Prompt improvements (retry limits, diagnostic requirements)
- ✅ Phase 2: Automated detection (retry tracking, blocker detection)
- ✅ Phase 3: UI and API infrastructure
  - Full web UI dashboard at `/interventions`
  - API endpoints for active/history/resume
  - Multi-channel notification service (webhook, email, SMS)
  - Pause/resume session manager
  - Auto-recovery manager

**What Needs Implementation:**
1. **Database Schema Creation**
   - Apply `schema/postgresql/011_paused_sessions.sql` migration
   - Create tables: `paused_sessions`, `intervention_actions`, `notification_preferences`
   - Create views: `v_active_interventions`, `v_intervention_history`

2. **Database Integration Options:**
   - **Option A**: Extend `TaskDatabase` abstraction with intervention methods
   - **Option B**: Use raw asyncpg connections in `PausedSessionManager`
   - **Option C**: Create separate `InterventionDatabase` class

3. **Required Methods:**
   - `pause_session()` - Save session state to database
   - `resume_session()` - Retrieve and mark resolved
   - `get_active_pauses()` - Query active interventions
   - `get_intervention_history()` - Query resolved interventions
   - `log_intervention_action()` - Audit trail

**Current Workaround:**
All database operations in `core/session_manager.py` are stubbed to return empty results or mock data, allowing the UI to function without errors.

**Priority:** HIGH - Core safety feature
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Documentation:** See [docs/intervention-system-phase3.md](docs/intervention-system-phase3.md)

### 4. Spec File Generator - Companion Tool
**Status:** Concept phase - Standalone project

**Vision:** Interactive wizard that helps users create comprehensive specification files optimized for YokeFlow.

**Inspiration Sources:**
- **B-MAD** - Structured requirements gathering
- **SpecKit** - Template-based spec generation

**Core Concept:**
Instead of users starting with a blank file, guide them through a structured interview process that generates a complete, well-formatted spec file proven to work with YokeFlow.
