# Simple Web Application for Playwright Docker Testing

Create a minimal web application to test Playwright Docker integration.

## Requirements

1. **Simple Express Backend** (port 3001)
   - GET /api/health - Returns { status: "ok", timestamp: Date.now() }
   - GET /api/message - Returns { message: "Hello from Docker!" }

2. **Simple Frontend** (port 5173)
   - Single HTML page with:
     - Title: "Playwright Docker Test"
     - H1: "Testing Playwright in Docker"
     - Button: "Test API" that fetches /api/message
     - Div to display the API response
   - Should log to console: "Page loaded successfully"

3. **Project Structure**
   - server/index.js - Express server
   - frontend/index.html - Simple HTML page
   - frontend/script.js - JavaScript for API interaction
   - init.sh - Script to start both servers

## Testing Requirements

After implementation, verify with browser automation that:
- Frontend loads without errors
- API health check returns 200
- Button click fetches and displays message
- Console has no errors

This is specifically designed to test Playwright running inside Docker containers.
